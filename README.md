## Introduction
This project focuses on developing an autonomous mini vehicle capable of understanding and executing Turkish voice commands given in natural language. It combines speech recognition, natural language processing, and microcontroller-based motion control to enable the system to interpret user instructions and respond with appropriate movements. The importance of this project lies in its potential applications in voice-controlled robotics, smart mobility systems, and human-machine interaction in Turkish-speaking contexts. As an outcome, it can contribute to advancements in localized AI systems, enhance accessibility, and serve as a foundation for more complex autonomous systems.

Moreover, mini vehicle provides voice during the actions which is called as text-to-speech (TTS) API. Real-time voice feedback is also in natural toned, Turkish language. 
Mini vehicle separates the commands according to it’s capacity and abilities. It responds to convenient commands with proper actions and voice. If command is inconvenient for requirements and abilities, vehicle states that circumstance. Raspberry PI 4 microcontroller is used for web applications, real-time status display, recognized speech, translated commands, and action history. An interface is developed for presentation of these applications. It is equipped with Wi-Fi communication. Therefore, standard communication protocol TCP is used. In addition, GPT AI Service is used for command interpretation. Manufacturing budget is constrained with 20.000 TL.
